# Reddit Mobile
Reddit Mobile is a mobile version of [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) using the React-Native Library. View the most up to date and trending reddit articles in an elegant UI.
## Prerequisites
- You will need Node.js, Watchman, the React Native command line interface, and Xcode.
- Please go to [React Native Setup](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) to install React Native

## Installation
1. Open new terminal window
2. `git clone https://github.com/aarboleda1/Reddit_Mobile.git` - clone repo
3. `cd ./Reddit_Mobile`
4. `npm install` - install dependencies
5. `react-native run-ios`

## Features
- Redux
- Fast relaunch using `redux-persist` to display that content first before fetching for new content
- Routing using react-router-native-flux
- Refresh on scroll using RefreshControl

## Milestones and Tasks

**Basic:**
- [x] Use Redux.
- [x] Create a main screen that fetches from Redditâ€™s API (https://www.reddit.com/.json) and displays the basic content (author, title, thumbnail, up votes, etc) in a list.
- [x] Users should be able to pull to refresh the list.
- [x] Clicking on a specific item should transition to a different screen within the app. This screen's content can just simply display the same basic content. Users should be able to go back to lsthe main screen.

**Bonus Points:**

- [x] Be able to store the fetched content locally so that if you relaunch the app, it will display that content first before fetching for new content. I recommend using Redux Persist or AsyncStorage.
- [ ] Works on both iOS and Android.

## Todo
- Verify app works on Android platform
