# Reddit_Mobile

- [x] Use Redux.
- [x] Create a main screen that fetches from Redditâ€™s API (https://www.reddit.com/.json) and displays the basic content (author, title, thumbnail, up votes, etc) in a list.
- [x] Users should be able to pull to refresh the list.
- [x] Clicking on a specific item should transition to a different screen within the app. This screen's content can just simply display the same basic content. Users should be able to go back to the main screen.

Bonus Points:

- [ ] Be able to store the fetched content locally so that if you relaunch the app, it will display that content first before fetching for new content. I recommend using Redux Persist or AsyncStorage.
- [ ] Works on both iOS and Android.
