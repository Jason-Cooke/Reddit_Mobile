## Features
1. Redux
2. Data persistence using redux-persist AsyncStorage for fast upload upon page refreshal
3. Routing using react-router-native-flux
4. Refresh on scroll using RefreshControl

## Milestones and Tasks
- [x] Use Redux.
- [x] Create a main screen that fetches from Redditâ€™s API (https://www.reddit.com/.json) and displays the basic content (author, title, thumbnail, up votes, etc) in a list.
- [x] Users should be able to pull to refresh the list.
- [x] Clicking on a specific item should transition to a different screen within the app. This screen's content can just simply display the same basic content. Users should be able to go back to lsthe main screen.

**Bonus Points:**

- [x] Be able to store the fetched content locally so that if you relaunch the app, it will display that content first before fetching for new content. I recommend using Redux Persist or AsyncStorage.
- [ ] Works on both iOS and Android.
